    <ul>
    <li><b>Step 1 Prepare the chenna</b></li>
    <p>To prepare this easy sweet recipe from a scratch, you need to begin with making the chenna at home. Take a deep bottomed saucepan and boil 1 1/2 litres of milk at a high flame. Once the milk starts boiling, turn off the flame. Mix water with lemon juice and add into the hot milk. Once the milk starts crumbling, drain out the excess water using a muslin cloth and tightly tie the crumbled milk extracts in the cloth. Put it aside for 15-20 minutes.</p>
    <li><b>Step 2 Prepare the sugar syrup</b></li>
    <p>Rub the chhena till it's soft like white butter and you can make a dough out of it. Once done, make some balls with the dough and press them a little. Repeat the process till the dough is finished. Cover them with a wet cloth and then prepare the sugar syrup. For the same, put a kadhai over medium flame and add 2 cups of sugar in it along with 1 1/2 litre hot water. Just boil the water and your sugar syrup is ready, add your rasmalai in the sugar syrup and boil for 5 minutes. The rasmalais will turn double and this is the indication to turn off your flame.</p>
    <li><b>Step 3 Prepare the saffron milk for Rasmalai</b></li>
    <p>Take a deep bottomed pan and boil the remaining milk in it. Once the milk starts boiling, add saffron in it along with chopped pistachios and almonds. Allow this milk blend to attain a slightly thick consistency for about 5-7 minutes. Now, add 1 cup sugar in it and mix well. Once the milk blend is reduced to half, turn off the flame and transfer it to a bowl.</p>

    <li><b>Step 4 Dip the sweet balls and indulge in the goodness</b></li>
    <p>Now, add the sugar syrup in a bowl filled with ice cubes. Add the rasmalai in this hot-cold sugar syrup one by one. Keep them in it for 2 minutes and then squeeze the extra water and add the rasmalai in saffron milk. Let the rasmalai soak for 3-4 hours to absorb the creamy texture of the milk. It tastes best when served chilled!.</p>
